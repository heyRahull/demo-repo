With over 3 years of experience as a Frontend Developer, I’ve worked extensively with technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WordPress, as well as tools such as Git, GitHub, Figma, and Miro. I've had the opportunity to contribute to high-traffic platforms like the H&M Careers website, focusing on enhancing user experience and functionality. Throughout my career, I’ve developed strong communication and client interaction skills, working closely with Swedish clients to understand their needs and deliver tailored solutions. This collaborative approach has helped me foster productive relationships and ensure that business goals are met. I’m passionate about working in agile environments and collaborating with cross-functional teams to create seamless and impactful web experiences.
