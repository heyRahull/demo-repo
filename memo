With over 3 years of experience as a Frontend Developer, I've worked with technologies like React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WordPress, as well as tools like Git, GitHub, Figma, and Miro. I've contributed to high-traffic platforms such as the H&M Careers website, enhancing user experience and functionality. Throughout my career, I've honed strong communication and client interaction skills, collaborating closely with Swedish clients to deliver tailored solutions. I thrive in agile environments, working with cross-functional teams to create seamless web experiences and meet business goals.
