1. Numerical Ability (Quantitative Aptitude)
-------------------------------------------
Number System:
- LCM (Least Common Multiple):
  LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)
  Shortcut: LCM × HCF = Product of numbers

- HCF (Highest Common Factor):
  HCF is the highest number that divides given numbers completely.

- Divisibility Rules:
  2 → Last digit is even.
  3 → Sum of digits is divisible by 3.
  4 → Last two digits form a number divisible by 4.
  5 → Last digit is 0 or 5.
  6 → Divisible by both 2 and 3.
  8 → Last three digits form a number divisible by 8.
  9 → Sum of digits is divisible by 9.
  11 → Alternating sum difference is divisible by 11.

Mensuration (Geometry)
----------------------
2D Shapes:
- Rectangle: Area = L × B, Perimeter = 2(L + B)
- Square: Area = s², Perimeter = 4s
- Circle: Area = πr², Circumference = 2πr
- Triangle: Area = (1/2) × b × h, Perimeter = a + b + c
- Equilateral Triangle: Area = (√3/4) × a²
- Trapezium: Area = (1/2) × (a + b) × h

3D Shapes:
- Cube: Volume = s³, TSA = 6s²
- Cuboid: Volume = L × B × H, TSA = 2(LB + BH + LH)
- Cylinder: Volume = πr²h, TSA = 2πr(h + r)
- Sphere: Volume = (4/3)πr³, TSA = 4πr²

Arithmetic Ability
-------------------
- Percentages:
  x% of y = (x/100) × y
  To increase x by y%: New value = x × (100 + y) / 100

- Profit & Loss:
  Profit% = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100
  Loss% = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100
  Selling Price (SP) = CP × (100 + Profit%) / 100
  Discount% = [(Marked Price - Selling Price) / Marked Price] × 100

- Interest:
  Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100
  Compound Interest (CI) = P(1 + R/100)ⁿ

- Ratios & Proportions:
  If a:b = x:y, then a = kx and b = ky

Speed, Time & Distance:
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Relative Speed: 
  - Opposite direction: S₁ + S₂
  - Same direction: |S₁ - S₂|
- Time to cross a platform = (Train Length + Platform Length) / Speed

Time & Work:
- If A completes work in x days, A’s 1-day work = 1/x
- If A is n times efficient than B, A takes 1/n of B’s time

Clocks & Calendar:
- Minute hand moves: 6° per min
- Hour hand moves: 30° per hour
- Angle between hands = |(30H - 5.5M)|
- Odd days: Normal year = 1, Leap year = 2

Elementary Statistics:
- Mean = Sum of terms / Number of terms
- Median = Middle term (when sorted)
- Mode = Most frequently occurring term
- Variance = Σ(x - Mean)² / N
- Standard Deviation = √Variance

2. Logical Reasoning
---------------------
Seating Arrangements:
- Circular: Left → Clockwise, Right → Counterclockwise
- Linear:
  - Facing Same Side = Normal arrangement
  - Facing Opposite = Left ↔ Right swapped

Blood Relations:
- Son of your father’s brother → Cousin
- Father of your wife → Father-in-law
- Mother’s sister’s son → Cousin

Syllogism:
- Use Venn diagrams to check conclusions.

Data Sufficiency:
- A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient
- B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient
- C: Both statements together are needed
- D: Neither is sufficient

3. Verbal Ability
------------------
Grammar:
- Articles: (a, an, the)
- Prepositions: (on, in, at, by, with, for, since, until)

Tenses:
- Present: I work / He works
- Past: I worked / He worked
- Future: I will work / He will work

Sentence Completion:
- Fill in the blank with correct preposition, verb form, or conjunction.

Error Spotting:
- Subject-Verb Agreement: She go → She goes
- Wrong tense usage: He has went → He has gone

Reading Comprehension:
- Tip: Read the question first, then scan the passage for answers.
